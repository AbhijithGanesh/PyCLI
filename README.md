# PyCLI - Empowering Python Developers

PyCLI is a versatile command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to cater to the diverse needs of Python developers. With its comprehensive set of utilities, PyCLI aims to streamline various aspects of development, making it an indispensable tool in the Python ecosystem.

An utiltarian CLI that will handle the needs of python developers. The following utilities will be supported soon:

- Pip packages
- Environment management (Virtual environment)
- Server (Gateway Interface servers) management
- Launcher management (Ports, files, env variables)



## Key Features

### 1. Managing Pip Packages

PyCLI simplifies package management by offering an intuitive interface to handle Pip packages. Whether you need to install, update, or uninstall packages, PyCLI has you covered. Its user-friendly commands ensure a seamless experience when working with Python dependencies.

### 2. Environment Management (Virtual Environment)

Efficiently managing Python environments is crucial for maintaining project dependencies. PyCLI provides a hassle-free way to create, activate, and deactivate virtual environments. This isolation ensures that your projects remain isolated and self-contained, preventing conflicts between different projects' dependencies.

### 3. Server Management (ASGI/WSGI)

PyCLI makes server management effortless. Whether you're dealing with ASGI or WSGI servers, PyCLI provides tools to start, stop, and configure them. This feature is a boon for developers deploying web applications, making server management a breeze.

### 4. Launcher Management (Ports, Files, Environment Variables)

Managing various aspects of launching applications becomes straightforward with PyCLI. You can easily set up port configurations, specify files to be executed, and manage environment variables. This flexibility ensures that your applications run smoothly across different environments.

### 5. Dynamic Python Version Management (Similar to NVM)

Taking inspiration from Node Version Manager (NVM), PyCLI introduces dynamic Python version management. Developers can effortlessly switch between different Python versions based on their project requirements. This feature enhances compatibility and empowers developers to work with specific versions as needed.

### 6. Web Server Configuration Storage as TOML

Storing web server configurations is made more convenient with PyCLI. The tool supports storing configurations using TOML, a human-readable configuration file format. This ensures that your server settings can be easily managed, versioned, and shared among team members.

PyCLI is more than just a CLI tool; it's a valuable companion for Python developers, helping them overcome common development challenges and boosting their productivity. Its user-centric design and rich feature set make it an essential addition to any Python developer's toolkit.

**Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance PyCLI and introduce new features to empower the Python developer community.**
